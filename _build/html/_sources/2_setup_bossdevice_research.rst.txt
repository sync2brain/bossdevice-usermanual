The bossdevice plugs into a compatible EEG amplifier on the input side and generates a fuzzy logic based binary signal on the output side. It reads a real-time biosignal data stream and generates a  signal when a pre-defined EEG-state is detected. The bossdevice is programmable from Matlab and enables complex experiments to be fully automated. Setting up the device involves several steps and the next sections descibre their details. 

Pre-requisites
====================================
-  Windows 10 operating system
-  MatLab R2021a
-  Simulink for MatLab R2021a update release 5
-  Simulink Coder add-on
-  Simulink Real-time add on
-  Simulink Real-Time target support package (add on)
-  The bossdevice RESEARCH API (download from here). The API contain the Matlab classes needed to control the device as well as a few MatLab demo scripts as example of codes that could be implemented to work with the device.
-  The bossdevice RESEARCH firmware, accessible at sync2brain.com/downloads.
-  Hardware drivers named as Speedgoat I/O Blockset R2021a (v9.2.2.1) drivers, accessible at sync2brain.com/downloads.

.. code-block::

   IP Address:          192.168.7.10
   Subnet mask:         255.255.255.0
   Default gateway:     
   DNS server:          

6. Click OK and OK on your way out of the wizard.


Simulink Real-Time Target Support Package
=========================================
When starting Matlab 2021 release 5 for the first time, additional installations are needed.
In the Home tab, click on Add-Ons ü°™ Get Add-ons and look for Simulink Real-Time Support Package. Install it, it will ask you to log in with your MatLab credentials.

Download & Install Hardware Drivers
======================================
Specific drivers for the hardware of bossdevice RESEARCH  must be downloaded installed at the first time using bossdevice RESEARCH with the new installation of Matlab, specifically the Speedgoat I/O Blockset for R2021a (v9.2.2.1). In order to download the drivers, visit sync2brain.com/downloads and download the Speedgoat I/O Blockset. When downloaded, unzip the file and save it in a temporary folder that must be deleted from the computer after the installation have been completed.   

The hardware drivers must be installed manually. Go into the unzipped drivers‚Äô folder from Matlab path search, right click on the executable in there and run the installation (a documentation page will pop up, just close it as not necessary). When asked by Matlab, accept the waiver and type Y (i.e., yes) twice; the second Y will close the software as Matlab needs to be restarted after this installation.
At the end of these two installations, reopen Matlabv and type Speedgoat to check that everything ran smoothly. If successful, a hardware dedicated window of speedgoat should pop up with different options available (e.g., troubleshoot, support, etc.).

Windows Firewall Check
======================
First, make sure all the network communication for Matlab R2021a are all allowed in the Windows Defender Firewall. To do this, search for Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security and look for Matlab R2021a Inbound and Outbound rules: if they are blocked, right click and Allow them. If they are already allowed, exit and continue to the next step.


Software Update on bossdevice
=============================
This step is also needed only once in the beginning of setup. In Matlab, type slrtExplorer: a new window should pop up. If you want, change the name of the device (meaningful could be bossdevice), and click on Software Update (not a necessity but still good step just in case). When the update is finished, click on the Disconnected button at the top left corner of the window. A connection (shown by a green symbol) should be established. If this is not the case, the sync2brain support team should be contacted for support.

Please note: if the bossdevice RESEARCH main screen shows a Matlab version different from Matlab R2021a, a major update is necessary. In this case, the sync2brain team should be contacted for support. After the update is made, make sure to switch off and on the device for complete update.


Configure biosignal Ethernet port of bossdevice
===============================================
The connection between the bossdevice RESEARCH and biosignal amplifier (NeurOne/TurboLink) can be done now. In Matlab, type speedgoat.configureEthernet and a new window should pop up. If the window have not popped up, carefully repeat all the above mentioned steps. Select your device from the dropdown menu: its features should appear in the window below. On the right-hand side, type the following:

.. code-block::

   IP Address:          192.168.200.255
   Subnet mask:         255.255.255.0
   Default gateway:     192.168.7.5 


You can then click on Load configuration. If the green light appears, the communication has been successfully established.

Setup bossdevice API
====================
Your bossdevice RESEARCH is now ready to work! In MatLab, go into the bossdevice API folder or simply add the path to the code. Type b = bossdevice; in Matlab and check that the firmware is being loaded (i.e., that no error appears and the status on the screen attached to the bossdevice is updated). You can now run the demo script or your experimental paradigm.

Please note: if you encounter an out-of-date error when trying to load the firmware it could be a problem of Matlab not being able to read the firmware properly. In this case, contact the sync2brain team for support.

Connecting with Biosignal Amplifier (EEG Device)
================================================
The input of the bossdevice i.e. the EEG data is provided by connecting the Biosignal Amplifier (EEG device e.g. Bittium's NeurOne or Brain Product's actiCHamp) with the bossdevice using a standard LAN Cable. Search the ‚ÄúREAL TIME OUT‚Äù LAN port at the back plate of your EEG device and connect it to the ‚ÄúBiosignal‚Äù LAN port available at the bossdevice research. More details on this topic are available in the chapter 4 'Setup Biosignal Amplifier'. You can also see the "Biosignal" port on the bossdevice research in the figure shown below.
