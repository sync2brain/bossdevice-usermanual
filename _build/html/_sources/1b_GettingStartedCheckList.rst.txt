2. NeurOne biosignal amplifier with firmware 1.4.30 or above.
3. A computer running any windows 10 operating system.
4. NeurOne software installed on the windows computer version 1.5.1 or above.
5. MATLAB release 2021a installaled on the windows 10 computer.
6. Install Simulink, Simulink Real-Time, Simulink Coder and MATLAB Coder under MathWorks 2021a products.
7. 1x LAN cable connecting NeurOne biosignal amplifier and the bossdevice as explained in section 3.1.
8. 1x LAN cable connecting bossdevice and windows 10 computer as described in section 3.2 of bossdevice usermanual.
9. 1x LAN cable connecting NeurOne biosignal amplifier and windows 10 computer, more details on this topic can be found in NeurOne usermanual.
10. Setup NeurOne LAN connection on the windows 10 computer, more details on this topic can be found in NeurOne usermanual.
11. Setup bossdevice LAN connection on the windows 10 computer as described in section 3.2 of bossdevice usermanual.

.. important::

    It is possible to run the NeurOne EEG software and the Matlab control script both on the same computer. In this case, we recommend a computer with 3 network connections: (1) Wired ethernet connection to the NeurOne Main Unit; (2) Wired ethernet connection to the bossdevice; (3) Wired or wireless internet/local area network connection.
